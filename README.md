# Flipkart-Database
OOAD Project
# To import file from text.sql  
1. if you know password of mysql command is : 
  mysql -u username -p your_databasename < filename_you_want_to_run.sql
2. if you don't know password of mysql command is : \
  sudo mysql -u username -p < your_databasename >  filename_you_want_to_run.sql

Beware that above commands have a field " your_databasename ". So, make a database with name Flipkart before running the above commands. 

# password and username for mysql should be same across all systems
username : ooad\
password : ooad

so create a user in mysql and grant it all privileges.
